Source Files : 
	"makefile", "main.cpp", "mapleGraph.mw", an example of "k6.txt"

Instructions :
	mapleGraph generats a text file "k6" that contains the information about a general undirected graph.
	With main.cpp you can load the graph generated by mapleGraph and modify it by adding or delete nodes or edges,
	or build a graph from scratch by adding links manually.

Implemented Methods :
	Add links and nodes,
	Delete links,
	Delete nodes,
	Print Laplacian matrix,
	Print Adjacency matrix,
	Print Degree matrix,
	Compute Eigenvalues of Laplacian matrix,
	Check if the graph is Directed or Undirected,
	Check if the graph is connected or not connected, moreover if it is weakly connected, strongly connected or 
		simply connected and if	the dynamic equation x_dot = -Lx , where L is the Laplacian, leads to consensus. 
	Compute the number of possible Spanning tree
	Check if the graph is a Spanning tree
	Compute a possible Spanning tree (since the graph are unweighted all the spanning trees are minimum Spanning trees) 
		[I've tried to compute the minimum heigh spanning tree but I'm not sure the algorithm is correct]
	Compute a connected subgraphs (given a node of the graph)
	Compute all the strongly connected subgraphs (given the cliques dimension)
